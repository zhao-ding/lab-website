						<i>Abstract</i> &mdash; Developing an automated vehicle, that can handle the complicated driving scenarios and appropriately interact with other road users, requires the ability to semantically learn and understand the driving environment, oftentimes,
						based on the analysis of massive amount of naturalistic driving data. An important paradigm that allows automated vehicles to both learn from human drivers and develop deeper insights is understanding traffic primitives, representing principal compositions
						of the entire traffic. However, the exploding driving data growth presents a great challenge in extracting primitives from a long-term multidimensional time-series traffic scenario data with multiscale varieties of road users get involved. Therefore,
						automatic primitive extraction is becoming one of the cost-efficient ways to help autonomous vehicles understand and predict the complex traffic scenarios. In addition, the extracted primitives from raw data should 1) be appropriate for automated
						driving applications and also 2) be easily combined to generate new driving scenarios. Existing literature does not provide a method to automatically learn these primitives from large-scale traffic data. The contribution of this paper has two manifolds.
						One is that we proposed a new framework to generate new traffic scenarios from a handful of limited traffic data. The other one is that we introduce a nonparametric Bayesian learning method - a sticky hierarchical Dirichlet process hidden Markov
						model - that can automatically extract primitives from multidimensional driving data without prior knowledge of the primitive settings. The developed method is validated using one day of naturalistic driving data. Experiment results show that the
						nonparametric Bayesian learning method extracts primitives from traffic scenarios where both the binary and continuous events coexist.</p>

						<i>Abstract</i> &mdash; The enormous efforts spent on collecting naturalistic driving data in the recent years has resulted in an expansion of publicly available traffic datasets, which has the potential to assist the development of the self-driving
						vehicles. However, we found that many of the attempts to utilize these datasets have failed in practice due to a lack of usability concern from the organizations that host these collected data. For example, extracting data associated with certain
						critical conditions from naturalistic driving data organized in chronological order may not be convenient for a vehicle engineer that doesn't have big data analytics experiences. To address the general usability challenges of these publicly available
						traffic datasets, we propose TrafficNet, a large-scale and extensible library of naturalistic driving scenarios, aiming at bridging the gap between research datasets and practically usable information for vehicle engineers and researchers. The proposed
						web-based driving scenario database preprocesses massive raw traffic data collected in chronological order into an organized scenario-based dataset by applying a set of categorization algorithms to label the naturalistic driving data with six different
						critical driving scenarios. TrafficNet opens not only the scenario library but also the source code of these categorization methods to the public, which will foster more sophisticated and accurate scenario-based categorization algorithms to advance
						the intelligent transportation research. The source code and the scenario database can be accessed at https://github.com/TrafficNet.</p>

						<i>Abstract</i> &mdash; Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC) was designed to provide reliable wireless communication for intelligent transportation system applications. Sharing information among cars and between cars and the infrastructure,
						pedestrians, or "the cloud" has great potential to improve safety, mobility and fuel economy. DSRC is being considered by the US Department of Transportation to be required for ground vehicles. In the past, their performance has been assessed thoroughly
						in the labs and limited field testing, but not on a large fleet. In this paper, we present the analysis of DSRC performance using data from the world's largest connected vehicle test program - Safety Pilot Model Deployment lead by the University
						of Michigan. We first investigate their maximum and effective range, and then study the effect of environmental factors, such as trees/foliage, weather, buildings, vehicle travel direction, and road elevation. The results can be used to guide future
						DSRC equipment placement and installation, and can be used to develop DSRC communication models for numerical simulations.</p>
